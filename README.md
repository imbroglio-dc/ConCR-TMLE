> Continuous-Time Targeted Maximum Likelihood Estimation for Survival
> Analysis with Competing Risks

## Description

`concrete` is an R package designed to use targeted maximum likelihood
estimation (TMLE) to compute covariate-adjusted marginal cumulative
incidence estimates in right-censored survival settings with and without
competing risks.
